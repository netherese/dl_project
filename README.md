# Ocular Disease Recognition

1.Built a baseline logistic regression model, achieving an accuracy of 88% on the training set.
2.Evaluated and optimized model performance by using accuracy and recall metrics to reduce false negatives.
3.Enhanced model performance by introducing additional hidden layers, increasing iterations, and employing Adam optimizer and He Normal initializer for optimal model selection.
4.Assessed validation performance using techniques such as L2 regularization, dropout regularization, batch normalization, and early stopping, resulting in a model with a loss of 0.615657, accuracy of 0.806706, and recall of 0.615385.
